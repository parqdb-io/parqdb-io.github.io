description: Understand source tables, open vector indexes, catalogs, snapshots, and query execution.

ParqDB keeps vector indexes as table data and executes search inside a SQL
runtime. The persisted index, catalog state, and execution runtime have separate
responsibilities.

## Source Table

A source table contains the original vectors and payload columns. ParqDB does
not copy those rows into a private database. Each indexed source declares one
or more key columns that join index candidates back to source rows.

The embedded runtime persists provider-neutral source definitions. Iceberg
references identify an exact metadata location, table UUID, and snapshot for
the native provider.

## Open Vector Index

An index consists of immutable JSON metadata and warehouse-relative Parquet
relations. The IVF
family stores:

- centroids used to choose candidate clusters; and
- postings that map clusters to source keys and, for LVQ4 or LVQ8, quantized
  vector codes.

Logical indexes over the same source state, vector field, metric, and cluster
count may share one immutable centroid artifact while keeping independent
postings. The [open index specification](/docs/spec) defines the metadata and table
schemas independently of the Python runtime.

## Catalog and Snapshots

The catalog maps a registered source and index name to the current immutable
metadata document. The embedded implementation uses SQLite. Posting rows and
vectors remain in Parquet rather than in the catalog.

Every successful build or refresh publishes a new immutable snapshot. The
catalog update is the publication point, so readers see either the previous
snapshot or the complete replacement, never partially written relations.

Parquet locations do not provide source snapshot isolation. Applications must
not replace registered Parquet files in place while an index depends on them.

## Warehouse

Each session has one warehouse URI. Index metadata, centroid data, and postings
all live below it, and portable metadata stores only warehouse-relative paths.
Catalog entries do not carry separate roots. A published index remains
portable: another session can register the same manifest in its own catalog
while using the same warehouse.

## Session and Execution

`parqdb.connect` returns a portable session facade. The embedded transport calls
the session service directly; the service owns a private DataFusion host and a
native Rust `LocalSession`. Public `Session` and `SourceTable` objects do not
inherit DataFusion classes.

`VectorQuery` is immutable and contains only table identity and search options.
Execution returns Arrow data. Embedded-only DataFusion operations are available
through the explicit `session.datafusion_context()` escape hatch.

## Query Lifecycle

An indexed query has four logical stages:

1. select the nearest IVF centroids;
2. scan postings for those cluster IDs;
3. apply source filters and compute distance; and
4. order by distance and retain the requested limit.

ParqDB may fuse or prune these stages physically without changing the index
format or result semantics.
