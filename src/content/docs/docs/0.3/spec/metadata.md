## Overview

A ParqDB catalog identifier points to the current immutable metadata file for
one logical index. The catalog owns the index name and source-table binding.
Each snapshot records the exact source table definition and the index provider
definitions required to reopen it after restart.

Metadata files are immutable, self-contained UTF-8 JSON documents. A catalog
commit atomically changes which file is current; readers may continue using a
previously loaded file subject to the catalog's retention boundary.

## JSON Serialization

Metadata is one JSON object conforming to RFC 8259.

- Field names and string values are case-sensitive.
- UUIDs use lowercase `8-4-4-4-12` hexadecimal strings.
- `int` and `long` are exact signed 32-bit and 64-bit JSON integers.
- Timestamps are Unix epoch milliseconds stored as `long`.
- Maps have unique keys and lists preserve order.
- Unknown fields, duplicate keys, missing required fields, incorrect types,
  and out-of-range integers are invalid.

## Provider Definitions

Common metadata does not interpret physical table locations or layouts. A
`table-definition` selects a registered DataFusion table-provider factory with
`provider` and supplies its versioned, non-secret `properties`. An
`index-provider-definition` does the same for physical index tables. Each
`index-table-definition` contains a positive `definition-version` and
provider-specific `properties`. Provider implementations validate those
properties, including any location rules.

## Index Metadata

The root object contains:

| Requirement | Field | Type | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| required | `format-version` | `int` | Must be `1`. |
| required | `index-uuid` | `string` | Stable, non-nil UUID of the logical index. |
| required | `last-updated-ms` | `long` | Creation time of this metadata file. |
| required | `last-sequence-number` | `long` | Greatest sequence number ever allocated. |
| required | `current-snapshot-id` | `long` | Current retained snapshot. |
| required | `snapshots` | `list<index-snapshot>` | Current and retained snapshots. |
| required | `snapshot-log` | `list<snapshot-log-entry>` | Current-snapshot history. |
| optional | `properties` | `map<string,string>` | Non-semantic properties. |

`index-uuid` remains unchanged across refreshes. `last-updated-ms` is no
earlier than the base metadata, retained snapshots, or snapshot-log entries.
Properties do not affect interpretation or query results.

### Index Snapshot

Each snapshot contains:

| Requirement | Field | Type | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| required | `snapshot-id` | `long` | Positive ID unique within the index. |
| required | `sequence-number` | `long` | Positive commit sequence. |
| required | `timestamp-ms` | `long` | Snapshot creation time. |
| required | `summary` | `map<string,string>` | Non-semantic provenance; may be empty. |
| required | `source-table` | `table-definition` | Exact source table state used to build this snapshot. |
| required | `vector-field` | `string` | Vector field in the catalog-bound source. |
| required | `source-key-fields` | `list<string>` | Ordered source key; non-empty and unique. |
| required | `indexed-rows` | `long` | Positive number of represented source rows. |
| required | `index-family` | `string` | Index-family identifier. |
| required | `index-schema-version` | `int` | Family schema version. |
| required | `metric` | `string` | Distance metric. |
| required | `parameters` | `map<string,string>` | Family-defined parameters. |
| required | `index-provider` | `index-provider-definition` | Provider for this snapshot's physical index tables. |
| required | `index-tables` | `map<string,index-table-definition>` | Family roles to immutable provider-defined tables. |

The catalog separately records the source binding used for index discovery.
It must match `source-table`; embedding the definition in each snapshot makes
the metadata self-contained and preserves the exact source state across
restart and future incremental updates.

Snapshot and sequence IDs are unique. No sequence exceeds
`last-sequence-number`. Snapshot list order has no meaning. The family spec
defines supported schema versions, metrics, parameters, and the exact set of
index-table roles.

These logical identity fields remain equal across retained snapshots:

- `vector-field`;
- `source-key-fields`;
- `index-family`; and
- `metric`.

Changing an identity field creates a new index UUID. Row count, parameters,
schema version, source state, and physical index tables may change in a
successor snapshot.

## Snapshot Log and Updates

Initial metadata has sequence number `1`, one current snapshot, and one log
entry. To publish a successor, a writer:

1. generates a new positive snapshot ID;
2. allocates `base.last-sequence-number + 1`;
3. appends one snapshot using that ID and sequence;
4. advances `last-sequence-number` and `current-snapshot-id`;
5. appends one snapshot-log entry; and
6. commits the fresh metadata location with catalog compare-and-swap.

Each log entry contains required `timestamp-ms` and `snapshot-id` fields. Log
timestamps are non-decreasing, every entry refers to a retained snapshot, and
the final entry refers to `current-snapshot-id`.

A metadata update may remove non-current snapshots and their log entries while
preserving `last-sequence-number`. Snapshot IDs are never reused.

## Source Binding

For a selected index, a reader validates that the catalog-bound source:

1. contains `vector-field` and every `source-key-fields` field;
2. satisfies the family-defined vector and key type requirements; and
3. has exactly `indexed-rows` rows when an existing index is registered.

The row count and schema checks are compatibility guardrails. The catalog
binding and snapshot `source-table` must identify the same exact state. Query
results preserve source columns and add only family-defined result fields.
